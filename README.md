## Caution
* NEVER rotate the motors by hand! You can and most probably will damage them.
* Motors tend to overheat during extend usage. Since this is a cat toy, stop it if not in use to prevent it from overheating.


##  To-Do (in no particular order)
* ~stop overheating~ [only for idle solved, long operations need hardware fix]
* better webserver UI for setting the movement range (if you have any ideas please tell me):
  * split configuration in seperate side?
* set maximum movement speed
* enter wifi credentials via webserver
* add fallback hotspot for controlling the toy outside
* add model for the base case
* toggle laser pointer via webserver
* show the current bounds
* [maybe] adding a timed mode where the duration until it automatically shutsdown can be set
* [maybe] adding the ability to schedule the activation (than timed mode would be neccessary too)
* If you have more ideas please let me know :)
