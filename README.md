##  To-Do
* better webserver UI for setting the movement range (if you have any ideas please tell me)
* set maximum movement speed
* enter wifi credentials via webserver
* add fallback hotspot for controlling the toy outside
* add model for the base case
* [maybe] adding a timed mode where the duration can be set
* [maybe] adding the ability to schedule the activation (than timed mode is neccessary too)
* If you have more ideas please let me know :)
